markers](https://istarkov.github.io/google-map-thousands-markers/)\n\n## The problem\n\nWith few thousands markers on the map a single hover animation over any marker will be slow.<br/>\nIt's not because of javascript, it's because browser can't render them fast.<br/>\nAll that layer composition events becomes too slow to show any single animation.\n\n## The solution\n\nTo draw markers on the html 5 canvas, and to hold a small buffer of components to draw hover events.\n\n## How to run locally\n\nclone and cd into the project.\n\nrun\n\n\\`\\`\\`shell\nyarn\nyarn run start\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Why\n\nFor unknown reasons some clients don't like any clustering on the map.\n\n## PS\n\nExample is highly unoptimized BTW it works well.<br/>\nAlso you can use this project as an example how to draw anything over the [google-map-react](https://github.com/istarkov/google-map-react)\n\n##\n`;\n\nexport const content = ({ theme }) => (\n  <div className={theme.main}>\n    <Container>\n      <Data
